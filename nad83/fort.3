                                                       EXPLANATION OF DATA


                                  Elevations are referenced to NGVD 1929. They are considered
                                  accurate to the nearest listed decimal. However if the
                                  observations were obtained from GPS, then a combination
                                  of the elevation accuracy and the geoid height accuracy
                                  will mean that the elevations are accurate to 1 meter.

                                  Geoid heights were obtained using RAPPS 180 X 180 model
                                  and are considered accurate to the nearest meter in the an
                                  absolute sense and relatively to the nearest decimeter.

                                  Note that State Plane Coordinate System values for the
                                  Northing (Y) and Easting (X) are given in meters in the
                                  NAD 83 system.
